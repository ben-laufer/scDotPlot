Description: Dot plots of single-cell RNA-seq data allow for an examination of the relationships between cell groupings (e.g. clusters) and marker gene expression. The scDotPlot package offers a unified approach to perform a hierarchical clustering analysis and add annotations to the columns and/or rows of a scRNA-seq dot plot. It works with SingleCellExperiment and Seurat objects as well as data frames.
